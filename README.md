# XiPaperCode

Code necessary to create [the X-inactivation paper]().  The intention is that everything will be run with the master script `00_fullPipeline.R`.

This is entirely self-contained, with the exception of external mapping of data, which is assumed to happen after line 1000 of `prepData.R`.

Version `0.4.2` of the R package `inactiveXX` was used.
